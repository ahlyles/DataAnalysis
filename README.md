# Hi, I'm Alisia

The Notebook file *Seattle Library Checkout Data Analysis* in this repository houses my analysis of data on checkouts from the Seattle Public Library for the years 2005, 2010, and 2015. In this Notebook I employ SQL and pandas, linked to my Microsoft SQL Server database using SQLAlchemy. The skills used in the development in this analysis include:

  - Filtering in SQL using the WHERE clause
  - LEFT and OUTER joins
  - Slicing with pandas `.loc` 
  - Aggregate functions 
  - Python function definition
  - Plotting with pandas `DataFrame.plot` and matplotlib
